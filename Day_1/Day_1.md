✨ Introduction
Overview of fundamental computing concepts and how they developed.

📜 History of Counting
Humans first counted with physical objects like stones, marks, or fingers before abstract number systems were created.

🏺 Ancient Number Systems
Egyptians → Base-60 & hieroglyphics

Greeks & Romans → Decimal arithmetic

Early calculation methods paved the way for modern mathematics.

💻 Computer Evolution
Key milestones:

⚙️ Mechanical devices (abacus, Pascal’s calculator)

🔌 First electronic computers (ENIAC, UNIVAC)

🖥️ Microprocessors → Modern PCs

🔢 Binary System & Conversions
Transistor invention enabled digital computing

Binary system → foundation of computing (0s & 1s)

Conversions:

Decimal ↔ Binary

Introduction to Octal (base-8) and Hexadecimal (base-16)

⚡ Transistors & Moore's Law
Transistors act as binary switches (ON/OFF).

Moore’s Law → chip density doubles roughly every 2 years.

🖥️ Programming Languages
Progression of abstraction:

Machine code (0s and 1s)

Assembly language

High-level languages (C, Python, Java, etc.)

📊 Data & DSA
Data = raw facts (e.g., age, name, scores).

DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) → optimize storage & processing efficiency.

📝 Summary
Evolution from stone counting → binary computing

Growth of computers, transistors, and Moore’s law

Rise of programming languages for human–machine communication

Central role of data & algorithms in problem-solving
