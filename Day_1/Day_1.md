## ✨ Introduction  
> Overview of fundamental computing concepts and how they developed.  

---

## 📜 History of Counting  
Humans first counted with **physical objects** like stones, marks, or fingers before abstract number systems were created.  

---

## 🏺 Ancient Number Systems  
- **Egyptians** → Base-60 & hieroglyphics  
- **Greeks & Romans** → Decimal arithmetic  
- Early calculation methods paved the way for **modern mathematics**.  

---

## 💻 Computer Evolution  
Key milestones:  
- ⚙️ Mechanical devices (abacus, Pascal’s calculator)  
- 🔌 First electronic computers (ENIAC, UNIVAC)  
- 🖥️ Microprocessors → Modern PCs  

---

## 🔢 Binary System & Conversions  
- **Transistor invention** enabled digital computing  
- **Binary system** → foundation of computing (0s & 1s)  
- Conversions:  
  - Decimal ↔ Binary  
  - Introduction to **Octal (base-8)** and **Hexadecimal (base-16)**  

---

## ⚡ Transistors & Moore's Law  
- Transistors act as **binary switches** (ON/OFF).  
- **Moore’s Law** → chip density doubles roughly every 2 years.  

---

## 🖥️ Programming Languages  
Progression of abstraction:  
1. **Machine code** (0s and 1s)  
2. **Assembly language**  
3. **High-level languages** (C, Python, Java, etc.)  

---

## 📊 Data & DSA  
- **Data** = raw facts (e.g., age, name, scores).  
- **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** → optimize storage & processing efficiency.  

---

## 📝 Summary  
- Evolution from **stone counting → binary computing**  
- Growth of **computers, transistors, and Moore’s law**  
- Rise of **programming languages** for human–machine communication  
- Central role of **data & algorithms** in problem-solving
