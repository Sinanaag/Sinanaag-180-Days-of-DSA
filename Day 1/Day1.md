# Day 1: Number Systems & Computer Fundamentals

**Date:** September 26, 2025

Today marks the beginning of my 180-day DSA challenge. The focus was on the foundational concepts of how computers store and process information, starting from the history of numbers to modern programming languages.

## üìù Topics Covered

1.  **History & Evolution of Numbers:**
    * Early counting methods (e.g., stones).
    * Ancient number systems like the Egyptian Base-60 system.
    * Introduction to the Base-10 (Decimal) system we use daily.

2.  **Computer Architecture Fundamentals:**
    * **Transistors:** The fundamental building blocks of modern electronics. Learned how they act as tiny switches that can be in an ON (1) or OFF (0) state.
    * **Moore's Law:** The observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years.

3.  **Number Systems for Computing:**
    * **Binary (Base-2):** The native language of computers, using only two digits: `0` and `1`.
    * **Octal (Base-8):** Uses digits `0-7`.
    * **Hexadecimal (Base-16):** Uses digits `0-9` and letters `A-F`. It's commonly used because it can represent a byte (8 bits) with just two characters.

4.  **Number System Conversions:**
    * **Decimal to Binary:** Practiced converting base-10 numbers to base-2 using the division-by-2 method.
    * **Binary to Decimal:** Learned to convert base-2 numbers back to base-10 by summing the powers of 2.

5.  **From Hardware to Software:**
    * **Machine Language:** The lowest-level language, consisting of binary code that the CPU can execute directly.
    * **Assembler:** A program that converts assembly language (human-readable mnemonics) into machine code.
    * **High-Level Languages (e.g., C++):** Abstracted languages that are easier for humans to write and understand, which are then compiled or interpreted into machine code.

6.  **The "Why": The Need for DSA**
    * Brief introduction to why efficient data handling (Data Structures & Algorithms) is critical for writing effective and scalable software.

## ü§î Key Takeaways

* Computers fundamentally operate on a simple binary system (ON/OFF switches) because it's reliable and easy to build with transistors.
* Higher-level number systems like Hexadecimal are used by programmers for convenience because they compact long binary strings. For example, `11111111` in binary is simply `FF` in hex.
* Understanding how data is represented at the lowest level is key to understanding how programs work and why DSA is so important for performance.
