# Day 2: Flowcharts, Conditionals & Loops

**Date:** September 27, 2025

Today's session was all about visualizing logic. I learned how to create flowcharts to map out program flow and solve problems step-by-step. This is the foundation for writing clean and logical code.

## üìù Topics Covered

1.  **Flowchart Fundamentals:**
    * **Concept:** A flowchart is a diagram that represents an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds and their order by connecting them with arrows.
    * **Terminologies:** Learned the meaning of standard symbols like Terminator (Start/End), Process (Calculations), Input/Output, and Decision (Conditional checks).

2.  **Algorithms with Flowcharts:**
    * **Sequential Logic:** Created simple, step-by-step flowcharts for problems like:
        * Sum and Average of two numbers.
        * Finding the cube and square of a number.
    * **Conditional Logic (Branching):**
        * Used the diamond-shaped decision block to create branches in logic.
        * Modeled real-world conditions (e.g., "Is it raining outside?").
        * Developed algorithms to check if a number is **Even/Odd** or **Positive/Negative**.
    * **Iterative Logic (Loops):**
        * Understood the concept of repeating a set of instructions.
        * Designed loops to print a number 10 times, print the first 'n' natural numbers, and calculate the sum of 'n' natural numbers.
        * Tackled a more complex problem: creating a flowchart to determine if a given number is a **Prime Number**.

## ü§î Key Takeaways

* **Plan Before You Code:** Flowcharts are an excellent way to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable steps before writing a single line of code.
* **The Three Pillars of Logic:** Almost any algorithm can be built using three basic control structures:
    1.  **Sequence:** Executing statements one after another.
    2.  **Condition (Selection):** Making a choice between two or more paths (e.g., `if-else`).
    3.  **Iteration (Loops):** Repeating a block of code (e.g., `for`, `while`).
* The logic for checking if a number is prime involves looping and conditional checks, which is a great combination of the concepts learned today.
