# Day 8: Hollow & Complex Patterns

**Date:** October 03, 2025

Today's challenge was to print hollow shapes. This required adding conditional logic (`if` statements) inside the inner loop to decide whether to print a star or a space based on the position (i.e., if it's a border element).

## üìù Topics Covered

* **Hollow Rectangle:** The logic is to print a star only if `i` is the first or last row, or if `j` is the first or last column. Otherwise, print a space.
* **Hollow Diamond:** This combines the logic of a full pyramid and an inverted full pyramid, with the added condition for printing only on the borders.
